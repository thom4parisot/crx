# crx [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/oncletom/crx.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/oncletom/crx)

> crx is a utility to **package Google Chrome extensions** via a *Node API* and the *command line*. It is written **purely in JavaScript** and **does not require OpenSSL**!

Packages are available to use `crx` with:

- *grunt*: [grunt-crx](https://npmjs.com/grunt-crx)
- *gulp*: [gulp-crx-pack](https://npmjs.com/gulp-crx-pack)
- *webpack*: [crx-webpack-plugin](https://npmjs.com/crx-webpack-plugin)

Massive hat tip to the [node-rsa project](https://npmjs.com/node-rsa) for the pure JavaScript encryption!

**Compatibility**: this extension is compatible with `node>=0.10`.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install crx
```

## Module API

Asynchronous functions returns an [ES6 Promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const ChromeExtension = require("crx");
const crx = new ChromeExtension(
  codebase: "http://localhost:8000/myFirstExtension.crx",
  privateKey: fs.readFileSync("./key.pem"))
});

crx.load("./myFirstExtension"))
  .then(crx => crx.pack())
  .then(crxBuffer => {
    const updateXML = crx.generateUpdateXML()

    fs.writeFile("../update.xml"), updateXML);
    fs.writeFile("../myFirstExtension.crx"), crxBuffer);
  });
```

### ChromeExtension = require("crx")
### crx = new ChromeExtension(attrs)

This module exports the `ChromeExtension` constructor directly, which can take an optional attribute object, which is used to extend the instance.

### crx.load(path|files)

Prepares the temporary workspace for the Chrome Extension located at `path` — which is expected to directly contain `manifest.json`.

```js
crx.load('/path/to/extension').then(crx => {
  // ...
});
```

Alternatively, you can pass a list of files — the first `manifest.json` file to be found will be considered as the root of the application.

```js
crx.load(['/my/extension/manifest.json', '/my/extension/background.json']).then(crx => {
  // ...
});
```

### crx.pack()

Packs the Chrome Extension and resolves the promise with a Buffer containing the `.crx` file.

```js
crx.load('/path/to/extension')
  .then(crx => crx.pack())
  .then(crxBuffer => {
    fs.writeFile('/tmp/foobar.crx', crxBuffer);
  });
```

### crx.generateUpdateXML()

Returns a Buffer containing the update.xml file used for `autoupdate`, as specified for `update_url` in the manifest. In this case, the instance must have a property called `codebase`.

```js
const crx = new ChromeExtension({ ..., codebase: 'https://autoupdateserver.com/myFirstExtension.crx' });

crx.load('/path/to/extension')
  .then(crx => crx.pack())
  .then(crxBuffer => {
    // ...
    const xmlBuffer = crx.generateUpdateXML();
    fs.writeFile('/foo/bar/update.xml', xmlBuffer);
  });
```

## CLI API

### crx pack [directory] [-o file] [--zip-output file] [-p private-key]

Pack the specified directory into a .crx package, and output it to stdout. If no directory is specified, the current working directory is used.

Use the `-o` option to write the signed extension to a file instead of stdout.

Use the `--zip-output` option to write the unsigned extension to a file.

Use the `-p` option to specify an external private key. If this is not used, `key.pem` is used from within the directory. If this option is not used and no `key.pem` file exists, one will be generated automatically.

Use the `-b` option to specify the maximum buffer allowed to generate extension. By default, will rely on `node` internal setting (~200KB).

### crx keygen [directory]

Generate a 2048-bit RSA private key within the directory. This is called automatically if a key is not specified, and `key.pem` does not exist.

Use the `--force` option to overwrite an existing private key located in the same given folder.

### crx -h

Show information about using this utility, generated by [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js).

## CLI example

Given the following directory structure:

```
└─┬ myFirstExtension
  ├── manifest.json
  └── icon.png
```

run this:

```bash
$ cd myFirstExtension
$ crx pack -o
```

to generate this:

```bash
├─┬ myFirstExtension
│ ├── manifest.json
│ ├── icon.png
│ └── key.pem
└── myFirstExtension.crx
```

You can also name the output file like this:

```bash
$ cd myFirstExtension
$ crx pack -o myFirstExtension.crx
```

to get the same results, or also pipe to the file manually like this.

```bash
$ cd myFirstExtension
$ crx pack > ../myFirstExtension.crx
```

As you can see a key is generated for you at `key.pem` if none exists. You can also specify an external key. So if you have this:

```
├─┬ myFirstExtension
│ ├── manifest.json
│ └── icon.png
└── myPrivateKey.pem
```

you can run this:

```bash
$ crx pack myFirstExtension -p myPrivateKey.pem -o
```

to sign your package without keeping the key in the directory.
